# dot
A simple cursor overlay for FPS. It currently just draws smack dab in the middle of your screen.

## Installation
Download [dot.exe](https://github.com/schtauffen/dot/releases/tag/v0.2.0). Click to start. You can exit from the taskbar icon.

## TODOS
1. figure out why the icon added so much filesize. Its a 5kb icon but implementing it added ~7mb.
1. get .exe signed so windows doesn't hate it so much
1. configuration (adjust position, toggle visibility)
1. allow to run on startup and hide taskbar icon?
